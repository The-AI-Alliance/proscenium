# Proscenium: Framing AI

Proscenium is a small library of composable glue that allows for
succinct construction of compound AI systems.  It is not (yet?) intended for production use.

There are a few ways to get started quickly:

- [Command Line Interface](./CLI.md) to demos
- [Notebooks](./notebooks/)
- Open the Proscenium repository in a [new GitHub Codespace](https://github.com/codespaces/new/The-AI-Alliance/proscenium)

## Goals

A few of the initial goals of this project include:

Proscenium is a library and a set of demonstration applications.
The applications illustrate a fuller picture of the application development and optimization process,
including:

- Data discovery, enrichment, and indexing
- Run-time inference patterns, including tool use
- Application characteristics that support auditability and accountability
- Decision support for product teams
- Integration patterns for collaborative enterprise workflows including chat systems and document editors

Proscenium uses text output, and does not offer any GUI, as it is meant to be
lower-level glue.

Further technical objectives include:

- Identify areas where innovation is still redefining interfaces
- Highlight designs that can limit the "blast radius" of those changes
- For users of frameworks, identify risk of lock-in
- Enumerate "glue code", libraries, or protocols that are missing from the ecosystem

Proscenium was started in February 2025 and is still in very early development.
